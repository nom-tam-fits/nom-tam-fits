			<action type="update">
				Image compression and tiling are now fully supported by nom-tam-fits. A 100% Java implementation of the compression libraries available in cfitsio

				When [de]compressing all available CPU's are automatically utilized.

			<action type="update">
				Internal compression allows FITS files to be created where the data are efficiently stored, but the
				metadata is still easily accessible. The tiling of images is particularly critical
				for supporting efficient access to subsets of very large images. A user can easily access
				only the tiles that overlap the region of interest and can skip data not of interest.
				While some skipping might be possible with uncompressed FITS files (i.e., read only the rows
				overlapping the desired
				subset), internal tiles can be much more efficient when the image is
				substantially larger than the subset. Most compression algorithms interfere with the ability to
				skip uninteresting data, but tiles are compressed independently, so users can benefit both from
				the compression and the selection of only a subset of the image.

				Fixed error in the writing of ASCII table columns where

			<action type="update" dev="Booth Hartley">
				This release contains some new features suggested by Booth Hartley (IPAC) who supplied
				modified code including:
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				Allow a FITS file to have invalid data after a valid FITS HDU.
				User can call FitsFactory.setAllowTerminalJunk(true) to enable
				this. The Fits
				object will return
				all valid HDUs. Note that
				whatever follows the valid FITS data must start with something
				that is clearly not FITs.
				This includes modifications to FitsFactory and
				Header.
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				Allow users to find original size of headers as they were
				read from some source file. The library throws away duplicate
				key values, so that the
				number of
				header cards in the header as read
				may be smaller than the original data. The getOriginalSize() gets
				the original size of the header in bytes. A resetOriginalSize()
				allows the
				user to tell the library that this header has been
				updated on disk and now has the same number of records as internally.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" dev="tmcglynn">
				Fixed the order of the EXTEND keyword to follow the NAXISn keywords
				when it is specified. This constraint on the EXTEND keyword is
				no longer required
				in the
				latest version of the standard, but it
				doesn't hurt anything and may make the file more acceptable to some

		<release version="1.06.0" date="2011-05-23">
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				Substantial reworking of compression to accommodate
				BZIP2 compression. The Apache Bzip library is used or
				since this is very slow, the user can
				specify a local
				command to do the decompression using the BZIP_DECOMPRESSOR
				environment variable. This is assumed to require a
				'-' argument which is added if not supplied by the
				user.
				The
				decompressor should act as a filter between standard input
				and output.
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				User compression flags are now completely
				ignored and the compression and the compression
				is determined entirely by the content of the stream.
				The

				classpath to accommodate BZIP2 inputs if the user
				does not supply the BZIP_DECOMPRESSOR.
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				Adding additional compression methods should be much easier and
				may only involve adding a couple of lines in the
				FitsUtil.decompress function if a

				class
				is available.
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				One subtle consequence of how compression is now handled
				is that there is no advantage for users to
				create their own BufferedDataInputStream's.
				Users should
				just provide a standard input stream
				and allow the FITS library to wrap it in a
				BufferedDataInputStream.

			<action type="fix" dev="V. Forchi">
				The placement of the header cursor after opening a primary array
				was such that unless the user took explicit action to move
				the cursor, new header
				records

				it would not affect the operations of this library). The
				library now leaves
				the
				cursor just after the EXTEND keyword where

				their
				part.noted originally by V. Forchi.

				This build procedure for FITS library has been changed. The library is now stored

				Adding more rigor to the transformation between bytes and strings and

				The standard also precludes other non-printing characters from strings.

				Handling fixed and variable length, single and double precision
				complex data. The library uses a float[2] or double[2]
				for a complex scalar.

				This
				is mostly bug
				fixes to existing code and changes are only
				in BinaryTable and BinaryTableHDU.

				The method BinaryTableHDU.setComplexColumn() allows the user to
				tell the FITS writer
				that a field
				which otherwise would be treated
				as a float or double array (with most rapidly varying
				dimensionality of 2) should be treated as complex.
				The internal
				data
				representations are
				identical.

				Variable length complex data will be found automatically if

				last dimension (for Java) is always 2, the first
				dimension is the number of rows in the table and the middle
				dimension is the number of complex numbers in
				the row and may
				vary
				from row to row. Other variable length columns are
				represented as 2-D arrays, where the first index points to the
				row, and the second index enumerates the
				elements in the row.

				Use of complex columns is illustrated in BinaryTableTest in the routines

				This release adds further support for large datasets where the size of
				an HDU may exceed 2GB. In ArrayDataInput (and the BufferedFile
				and
				BufferedDataInputStream that implement it)
				int skipBytes(int)
				method of java.io.DataInput is now overloaded with
				long skipBytes(long).

				In ArrayFuncs
				int computeSize(Object)
				method is

				It was not possible to use the same name here since the argument type
				is the same.
				Similarly
				int nElements(Object)

				matched with
				long
				nLElements(Object)

				These changes should not affect current usage of the existing methods.

				References to skipBytes and computeSize in the FITS classes now take
				advantage of these
				new methods.

				While these changes increase the support of the library for large datasets,
				there are still a number of restictions that arise from Java's limit that
				array indices
				must be ints. E.g., no single dimension can exceed 2 GB,
				and the total size of the heap for a given binary table HDU cannot
				exceed 2

				The regression tests have been augmented to test the new features, but users

				to run. E.g.,
				on the primary development machine this takes 240 seconds while all of the

			<action type="update" dev="L. Michel">
				ASCII tables with data fields that were blank filled were not being handled properly.
				According to the FITS standards, numeric fields where the
				FITS table has
				blanks are
				to be treated as containing 0. A parsing error was being returned. The getInt, getLong,
				and getDouble methods in ByteParser were changed to acoommodate
				this case
				(getFloat simply
				calls getDouble).suggested by L. Michel
			</action>
			<action type="update" dev="tmcglynn">
				A new exception, PaddingException, which inherits from FitsException has been added.
				This exception is thrown when an otherwise valid HDU is not
				properly
				padded to the next
				2880 byte boundary. The exception class has a getTruncatedHDU method which allows the
				user to get the information in the truncated HDU. In addition to
				the new
				class changes were
				made in BinaryTable, AsciiTable, UndefinedData, ImageData and RandomGroupsData to throw the
				exception at the appropriate
				time. The main Fits method was
				also
				updated so that when
				its readHDU() method is being used, the notional header that is given to the truncated HDU
				in the Data classes is replaced by the actual header. If a
				user
				wishes to ignore padding
				exceptions, then a FITS file may be read using the following idiom in the new nom.tam.fits.test.PaddingTester to see a complete example
				of this
				idiom.
