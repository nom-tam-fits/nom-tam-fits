KEYWORD:   AIRMASS
REFERENCE: NOAO    
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  real

giving the air mass during the observation by a ground based telescope.
The value of the airmass is often approximated by the secant of the
elevation angle and has a value of 1.0 at the zenith and increases
towards the horizon.  This value is assumed to correspond to the start
of the observation unless another interpretation is clearly explained
in the comment field.

KEYWORD:   APERTURE
REFERENCE:      
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   name of field of view aperture
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string which gives
the name of the instrumental aperture though which the observation was
made. This keyword is typically used in instruments which have a
selection of apertures which restrict the field of view of the detector.

DATATYPE:     string
COMMENT:   checksum for the current HDU
DEFINITION: The value field of the CHECKSUM keyword shall contain a 16 character
string, left justified starting in column 12, containing the ASCII
encoded complement of the checksum of the FITS HDU (Header and Data
Unit). The algorithm shall be the 32-bit 1's complement checksum and the
ASCII encoding that are described in the checksum proposal. The checksum is accumulated in
FITS datastream order on the same HDU, identical in all respects, except
that the value of the CHECKSUM keyword shall be set to the string
'0000000000000000' (ASCII 0's, hex 30) before the checksum is computed.

KEYWORD:   CHECKVER
REFERENCE: Checksum
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   version of checksum algorithm
DEFINITION: The value field of the CHECKVER keyword shall contain a
string, unique in the first 8 characters, which distinguishes between
any future alternative checksum algorithms which may be defined. The
default value for a missing keyword shall be 'COMPLEMENT' which will
represent the algorithm defined in the current proposal. It is
recommended that this keyword be omitted from headers which implement
the default ASCII encoded 32-bit 1's complement algorithm.

KEYWORD:   CONFIGUR

HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   software configuration used to process the data 
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string that
uniquely defines the configuration state, or version, of the the
software processing system that generated the data contained in the HDU.
This keyword differs from the CREATOR keyword in that it give the name
and version of the overall processing system and not just the name and
version of a single program.

KEYWORD:   CONTINUE
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  none
COMMENT:   denotes the CONTINUE long string keyword convention
DEFINITION: The CONTINUE keyword, when followed by spaces in columns 9
and 10 of the card image and a character string enclosed in single
quotes starting in column 11 or higher, indicates that the quoted string
should be treated as a continuation of the character string value in the
previous header keyword. To conform to this convention, the character
string value on the previous keyword must end with the ampersand
character ('&'), but the ampersand is not part of the value string and
should be deleted before concatenating the strings together. The
character string value may be continued on any number of consecutive
CONTINUE keywords, thus effectively allowing arbitrarily long strings to
be written as keyword values.

recorded in the FITS file. Example: some X-ray satellite data may be
recorded in 'BRIGHT', 'FAINT', or 'FAST' data mode.

KEYWORD:   DATASUM
REFERENCE: Checksum
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:     string
COMMENT:   checksum of the data records
DEFINITION: The value field of the DATASUM keyword shall be a character
string containing the unsigned integer value of the checksum of the
data records of the HDU.  For dataless HDU's, this keyword may either be
omitted, or the value field shall contain the string value '0', which
is preferred. A missing DATASUM keyword asserts no knowledge of the
checksum of the data records.

DEFINITION: The HIERARCH keyword, when followed by spaces in columns 9
and 10 of the FITS card image, indicates that the ESO HIERARCH keyword
convention should be used to interpret the name and value of the
keyword. The HIERARCH keyword formally has no value because it is not
followed by an equals sign in column 9. Under the HIERARCH convention
the actual name of the keyword begins in column 11 of the card image and
is terminated by the equal sign ('=') character. The name can contain
any number of characters as long as it fits within columns 11 and 80 of
the card image and also leaves enough space for the equal sign separator
and the value field. The name can contain any printable ASCII text
character, including spaces and lower-case characters, except for the
equal sign character which serves as the terminator of the name field.
Leading and trailing spaces in the name field are not significant, but
embedded spaces within the name are significant. The value field follows
the equals sign and must conform to the syntax for a free-format value
field as defined in the FITS Standard. The value field may be null, in
which case it contains only space characters, otherwise it may contain
either a character string enclosed in single quotes, the logical
constant T or F, an integer number, a floating point number, a complex
integer number, or a complex floating point number. The value field may
be followed by an optional comment string. The comment field must be
separated from the value field by a slash character ('/'). It is
recommended that the slash character be preceeded and followed by a
space character. Example: "HIERARCH Filter Wheel = 12 / filter
position". In this example the logical name of the keyword is 'Filter
Wheel' and the value is 12.

HDU:       table
DATATYPE:  real
COMMENT:   maximum physical value in the column
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
floating point number specifying the maximum valid physical value
represented in column n of the table, exclusive of any special values.
This keyword may only be used in 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions and
is analogous to the DATAMAX keyword used for FITS images.

KEYWORD:   TDMINn
REFERENCE: HEASARC     
HDU:       table
DATATYPE:  real
COMMENT:   minimum physical value in the column
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
floating point number specifying the minimum valid physical value
represented in column n of the table, exclusive of any special values.
This keyword may only be used in 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions and
is analogous to the DATAMIN keyword used for FITS images.

KEYWORD:   TELAPSE
REFERENCE: HEASARC     
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  real
UNIT:      s
COMMENT:   elapsed time of the observation
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a floating point number
giving the difference between the stop and start times of the
observation in units of seconds.  This keyword is synonymous with the
ELAPTIME keyword.

KEYWORD:   TIME-END
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   time at the end of the observation
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string that gives
the time at which the observation ended. This keyword is used in
conjunction with the DATE-END keyword to give the ending time of the
observation; the DATE-END keyword gives the ending calendar date, with
format 'yyyy-mm-dd', and TIME-END gives the time within that day using
the format 'hh:mm:ss.sss...'. This keyword should not be used if the
time is included directly as part of the DATE-END keyword value with the
format 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss'.

KEYWORD:   TIME-OBS
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   time at the start of the observation
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string that gives
the time at which the observation started. This keyword is used in
conjunction with the standard DATE-OBS keyword to give the starting
time of the observation; the DATE-OBS keyword gives the starting
calendar date, with format 'yyyy-mm-dd', and TIME-OBS gives the time
within that day using the format 'hh:mm:ss.sss...'. This keyword should
not be used if the time is included directly as part of the DATE-OBS
keyword value with the format 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss'.

KEYWORD:   TITLE
REFERENCE: ROSAT    
HDU:       any
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   title for the observation or data
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string giving a
title that is suitable for display purposes, e.g., for annotation on
images or plots of the data contained in the HDU.

KEYWORD:   TLMAXn
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       table
DATATYPE:  real
COMMENT:   maximum legal value in the column
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
floating point number specifying the upper bound of the legal range of
physical values that may be represented in column n of the table. The
column may contain values that are greater than this legal maximum value
but the interpretation of such values is not defined here. The value of
this keyword is typically used as the maxinum value when constructing a
histogram of the values in the column.  This keyword may only be used
in 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions.

KEYWORD:   TLMINn
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       table
DATATYPE:  real
COMMENT:   minimum legal value in the column
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
floating point number specifying the lower bound of the legal range of
physical values that may be represented in column n of the table. The
column may contain values that are less than this legal minimum value
but the interpretation of such values is not defined here. The value of
this keyword is typically used as the mininum value when constructing a
histogram of the values in the column.  This keyword may only be used
in 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions.

KEYWORD:   TSORTKEY
REFERENCE: HEASARC    
HDU:       table
DATATYPE:  string
COMMENT:   defines the sort order of a table
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string that
defines the order in which the rows in the current FITS ASCII or binary
table extension have been sorted. The character string lists the name
(as given by the TTYPEn keyword) of the primary sort column, optionally
followed by the names of any secondary sort column(s). The presence of
this keyword indicates that the rows in the table have been sorted
first by the values in the primary sort column; any rows that have the
same value in the primary column have been further sorted by the values
in the secondary sort column and so on for all the specified columns.
If more than one column is specified by TSORTKEY then the names must be
separated by a comma. One or more spaces are also allowed between the
comma and the following column name. By default, columns are sorted in
ascending order, but a minus sign may precede the column name to
indicate that the rows are sorted in descending order. This keyword may
only be used in 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions. Example: TSORTKEY =
'TIME, RA, DEC'.
