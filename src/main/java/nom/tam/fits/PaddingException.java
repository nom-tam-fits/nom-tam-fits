/**
 * This exception is thrown if padding is missing between the end of a FITS data
 * segment and the end-of-file. This padding is required by the FITS standard,
 * but some FITS writers may not add it. As of 1.17 our `Fits` class deals
 * seamlessly with such data, since the missing padding at the end-of-file is
 * harmless when reading in data. It will log a warning but proceed normally.
 * However, the exception is still thrown when using low-level
 * {@link Data#read(nom.tam.util.ArrayDataInput)} to allow expert users to deal
 * with this issue in any way they see fit.
