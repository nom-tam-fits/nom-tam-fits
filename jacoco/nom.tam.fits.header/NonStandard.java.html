     * The HIERARCH keyword, when followed by spaces in columns 9 and 10 of the
     * FITS card image, indicates that the ESO HIERARCH keyword convention
     * should be used to interpret the name and value of the keyword. The
     * HIERARCH keyword formally has no value because it is not followed by an
     * equals sign in column 9. Under the HIERARCH convention the actual name of
     * the keyword begins in column 11 of the card image and is terminated by
     * the equal sign ('=') character. The name can contain any number of
     * characters as long as it fits within columns 11 and 80 of the card image
     * and also leaves enough space for the equal sign separator and the value
     * field. The name can contain any printable ASCII text character, including
     * spaces and lower-case characters, except for the equal sign character
     * which serves as the terminator of the name field. Leading and trailing
     * spaces in the name field are not significant, but embedded spaces within
     * the name are significant. The value field follows the equals sign and
     * must conform to the syntax for a free-format value field as defined in
     * the FITS Standard. The value field may be null, in which case it contains
     * only space characters, otherwise it may contain either a character string
     * enclosed in single quotes, the logical constant T or F, an integer
     * number, a floating point number, a complex integer number, or a complex
     * floating point number. The value field may be followed by an optional
     * comment string. The comment field must be separated from the value field
     * by a slash character ('/'). It is recommended that the slash character be
     * preceeded and followed by a space character. Example: &quot;HIERARCH Filter
     * Wheel = 12 / filter position&quot;. In this example the logical name of the
     * keyword is 'Filter Wheel' and the value is 12.
