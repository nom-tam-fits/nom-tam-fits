# Release HOWTO


This document is meant for package maintainers only. Its purpose is to provide instructions on preparing and releasing updates to the __nom-tam-fits__ library.

## Prerequisites

To release packages, you will need to:

 1. have admin privileges on the mainline [nom-tam-fits](https://www.github.com/nom-tam-fits/nom-tam-fits) repo.
 
 2. have a Nexus Sonatype account. If not register one (see the [guide to publishing packages on Sonatype](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/)). We use the Sonatype Nexus repository for staging releases before pushing them to Maven Central, and also to provide automatic SNAPSHOT releases. (Releases, including SNAPSHOTs are pushed automatically to the Nexus repository by the GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/maven.yml`).
 
 3. have push privileges to the `gov.nasa.gsfc.heasarc` repo on Nexus. If you don't already have them, one of the other nom-tam-fits maintainers can request it for you. (It may take up to 2 days after the request to gain access).
 
 4. update the `NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD` repository secrets on github with your Nexus username and authentication token. At any point, there should be only one of the maintainers publishing packages to Nexus. So use your credentials only if you are that designated person.


## Preparing the release


 * Make sure the CI build on github passes without errors. If the CI build has issues, get them fixed before proceeding.
 
 * Check that unit tests coverage did not decrease compared to the prior release. (You should not merge pull request in the first place until they maintain or increase test coverage.) Small decrements in overall coverage due to a reduction in the total lines of code are acceptable, as long as the diff coverage itself is equal or above the previous coverage metric. (You should generally insist on 100% diff-coverage, unless there is a good reason why it cannot be attained.) 
 
 * Edit `src/changes/changes.xml` to summarize the changes for the release, linking entries to issues or pull request as appropriate. Commit and push the updates as necessary. Note any issues pertainig to compatibility at the top of the list of actions.
 
 * Update `pom.xml` with the latest (or best fit) plugin versions. Test them locally with `mvn clean package` before committing and pushing the POM to the repo. Alternatively, if dependabot is generating update PRs, make sure you integrate all that pass the CI.
 
 * Make sure the [Project Site](http://nom-tam-fits.github.io/nom-tam-fits/index.html) is in good shape. Click through the menu on the left panel and check that all content is current. Check that the changes are properly shown. Check that the _Getting Started_ guide has up-to-date instructions for using the library.
 


## Publishing the release

Once you are confident that everything is in perfect order for the next release, change the version number in `pom.xml`. Remove `-SNAPHOT` from the version. The release needs a proper version number, such a `1.17.2` for finalized release, or something like `1.17.2-rc5` for release candidates and pre-releases. 

 * Commit and push the updated `pom.xml` to the mainline master. Following a successful build, the Github Actions CI will upload the release artifacts to the Nexus staging repository.

 * Log into Sonatype Nexus ([oss.sonatype.org](https://oss.sonatype.org)) and click _Staging Repositories_ in the left menu panel. Your freshly packaged release should show up here. If you don't see it, it's either because Github Actions failed (or did not run at all), or because it uploaded to Nexus with someone else's credentials. If necessary, retrace your steps and fix what is needed to get the package published to Nexus staging with your credentials. 

 * Sleep on it. So far so good, but this is also you last chance to fix anything before the package really goes public, so don't rush it. Take some time to reflect on it, double or triple-check everything, before moving to the next step...

 * On Github, click on _Releases_, and create a new release:
   - Name and tag the release with by the version, such as `1.17.0-rc1` (Note, before 1.17.0 the tag included a 'nom-tam-fits-' prefix as well, which resulted in source tarballs named as nom-tam-fits-nom-tam-fits-<version> -- therefore starting with 1.17.0 we'll omit that).
   - Link the release to the last master commit of the repo.
   - If it is not a final release, be sure to check the box for _pre-release_ near the bottom (when checked the CI will not publish a Github package for this release).
   - Write up a summary of what's in the release. It can be a digested version of the changes, or some other concise summary.
   - Attach the signed package and javadoc JARs. (Best to use the signed JAR that has been uploaded to Nexus staging.)
   - After creating the release, delete any prior pre-releases (We should only track final releases in the long run).

 * After your upload to Sonatype Nexus, you need _Close_ the release, s.t. it cannot be modified further. (Prior to closing, in principle you could upload more artifacts from the same host as before -- but since we used the github CI to upload, there is little you can do to add anything really). Name the release with the version number, such as `1.17.0-rc4`.
 
 * Nexus will now give you options to _Release_ to Maven Central or _Drop_ it. If it is a final release, and you are ready to push it to Maven Central, then go ahead and click _Release_. Or, if it's a pre-release, you can drop it once it gets obsoleted (before then collaborators can access the pre-release on Nexus too, so do keep pre-releases around for them as long as it's appropriate).
 
 * Finally, edit `pom.xml`, and bump the version number and add `-SNAPSHOT`, for example: change the just released `1.17.0` to `1.17.1-SNAPSHOT`. I.e., from here on new commits on master will be part of the 1.17.1 development. Commit and push `pom.xml`.
